< = open

can seem to create sh functions(), can't seem to run them though
can also reference env vars by going ${VAR_NAME}, and the console prints them out (along with the usual permission denied message...)

uppershell process:
- read in input, capitalise all [a-z] text
- execute the resulting processed text in sh
- exec(capitalise(input))

Notes:
>> ~ 
sh: 1: /home/bandit32: Permission denied

>> ~/*
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>>

SOLUTION:
Depressingly, type "$0" into the terminal, which will resolve to the shell name (sh), which can then be used to cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
